# SHE-Static-Hair-Extractor

Final year Engineering Project.

Steps to recreate the model:-

1. Build a vacuum cleaner. You can refer to the video below to innovate a simple vacuum cleaner to implement this project:-

2. A TCS3200 sensor needs to be fitted next to the hose. It would be best to integrate the sensor with an Arduino board to run the motor when the black hair color is detected (you can also program it for other hair colors). The black color was programmed considering the majority of human hair color found in the world population.

3. A filter is required to enhance the vacuum capability of extracting hair and separating other waste.

4. You will now have the final model to play around with for experimenting with the project.
