# SHE-Static-Hair-Extractor

Final year Engineering Project.

## Steps to recreate the model

1. **Build a vacuum cleaner**. You can refer to the video below to innovate a simple vacuum cleaner to implement this project:-

2. **Fit a TCS3200 sensor next to the hose**. Integrate the sensor with an Arduino board to run the motor when the black hair color is detected (you can also program it for other hair colors). The black color was programmed considering the majority of human hair color found in the world population.

3. **Add a filter** to enhance the vacuum capability of extracting hair and separating other waste.

4. **Experiment with the final model** for your project.
